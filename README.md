## Settings File

QueryStudio persists app configuration in a single `settings.json` file in the Tauri AppConfig directory.

- Linux: `~/.config/<bundle-id>/settings.json`

The file is created automatically on startup if missing. If the file is invalid JSON, QueryStudio backs it up and regenerates defaults.
